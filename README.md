# Overview 
This repository contains the files required to fabricate the AirMeter.io Sensor Assembly PCB (Printed Circuit Board). This board connects the various sensor components without complicated & time consuming soldering of wires.

It makes a 10 minute job of what was a very labourious manual execerise preiviously.

Using these files the PCBs can be ordered from third party manufacturers at an insignificant cost.

# Ordering

As the PCB is small they must be ordered as "panelised boards". This means printing multiple PCBs on a single panel which has lines cut in a grid pattern so that it can be broken appart into the individual boards.

The test order for this design was done using JLCPCB and 5 panels each containing 6 boards (2 rows of 3) giving a total of 30 Sensor Assemblies. For indicative purposes this order came in at approximately â‚¬35 including delivery & VAT to EU.

Any suitably equiped PCB supplier should be able to print & panelise the gerber files within this repository.

It is advisable to consult someone experienced with designing & ordering PCBs before making an order. 

# Supported Sensors

These boards are layed out to work with the following sensors:-
- 3.3v I2C CO2 Sensors
    - Senseair Sunrise: 006-0-0007 (Recommended)
    - Senseair Sunrise: 006-0-0008 (Recommended)
    - Sensirion SCD30
- Temperature, Pressure, Humidity
    - BME 280 (Recommended)
    - BME 680 (Includes VOC)
    - BMP 280 (No pressure)

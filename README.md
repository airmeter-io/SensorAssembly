# Overview 
This repository contains the files required to fabricate the AirMeter.io Sensor Assembly PCB (Printed Circuit Board). This board connects the various sensor components without complicated & time consuming soldering of wires.

It makes a 10 minute job of what was a very labourious manual execerise preiviously.

Using these files the PCBs can be ordered from third party manufacturers at an insignificant cost.

# Ordering

As the PCB is small one must ordered these boards "panelised". This means printing multiple PCBs on a single panel which has lines cut so that it can be broken appart into the individual boards.

The test order for this design was done using JLCPCB and 5 panels each containing 6 boards (2 rows of 3) giving a total of 30 Sensor Assemblies. For indicative purposes this order came in at approximately â‚¬35 including delivery & VAT to EU.

Any suitably equiped PCB supplier should be able to print & panelise the gerber files within this repository.

It is advisable to consult someone experienced with designing & ordering PCBs before making an order.
